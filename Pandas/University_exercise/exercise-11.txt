(1) Read "college.csv" into a data frame. This is a subset of data about American universities from the year 2018.  The columns are:

    - city
    - state abbreviation
    - SAT average score
    - Institution name
    - Admission rate
    - Average number of months needed to complete a degree
    - Tuition fee (in US dollars) for in-state students

(2) Set the index to be based on the state abbreviation. What was the
    average SAT score in Massachusetts (MA)?  What was the average
    acceptance rate in Illinois?

(3) Now use a multi-index based on state and city name. How many schools
    are based in a city named "Cambridge" in the US? What's the average
    SAT score for schools in cities named "Cambridge"?

(4) Create a series for all schools in the states of California (CA),
    Illinois (IL), and New York (NY), with a multi-index of state and
    city, with a value of admission rate. Which school in Illinois has
    the highest admission rate?  Which school in California has the
    lowest admission rate?
