(1) Create an array of 10 random integers, from 0-100.

(2) Find the mean and standard deviation of these numbers.  

(3) Create another array of 10 random integers, from 0-100.

(4) Create a new array whose elements are the average of those from
    each of the previous ones.  

(5) Create an array of 10 random floats, from 0-100.

(6) We would expect the mean to be approaximately 50.  Is it?  What's
    the standard deviation?

(7) What are the min and max values?
